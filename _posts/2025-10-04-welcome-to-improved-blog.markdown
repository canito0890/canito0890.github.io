## A Fresh Look

Welcome to the improved version of my personal blog! I've made several enhancements to improve both the design and functionality of the site.

## Key Improvements

### Enhanced Configuration

The site now includes:

- **Better SEO**: Improved meta descriptions and social sharing
- **Professional Author Profile**: Updated bio and social links
- **Navigation Menu**: Easy access to all sections
- **Table of Contents**: Automatic TOC for better content navigation

### New Features

#### Archive Pages

You can now browse content in multiple ways:

1. **By Date**: View all posts chronologically
2. **By Category**: Browse posts grouped by topic
3. **By Tag**: Find posts with specific tags

#### Improved Styling

Custom CSS enhancements include:

- Smooth scrolling behavior
- Enhanced code block styling
- Better hover effects
- Improved spacing and readability
- Responsive design improvements

### Technical Enhancements

```yaml
# New configuration options
timezone: America/Mexico_City
paginate: 10
breadcrumbs: true
words_per_minute: 200
```

## Content Organization

### Categories vs Tags

I'm using a hybrid approach:

- **Categories**: Broad topics (e.g., "Software Development", "Technology")
- **Tags**: Specific concepts (e.g., "Python", "Git", "Docker")

This makes content easier to discover and navigate.

## What's Next?

I'm planning to write more about:

- Software development best practices
- Technology tutorials and guides
- Project showcases
- Learning experiences and insights

## Feedback Welcome
